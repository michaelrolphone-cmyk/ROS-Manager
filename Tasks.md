# Tasks TODO

## Application Framework

* With application synch features, now it is duplicating the traverse bearing and distance entries over and over again even only one user is connected 
* I would like the help.md refresh button removed. 

## Project Overview / Spring Board

* I would like a vicinity map app added to the spring board to view the clients property when the clients address has been configured for a project.
* I don't need an active indicator in the project overview on the spring board
* I would like the composite project thumbnail shown in the project overview on the springboard left of the project name and description with rounded corners

## Differential Levels

* Differential Levels export doesn't show the values for fs and bs in the pdf

## Navigation

* I would like a list of the nearest 5 points to my current location shown on the navigation app so I can see what is near me. 
* If a user hasn't been connected to the app for more than 5 minutes don't show them on the navigation page
* I would like to be able to toggle between map and compass view on the navigation page

## Evidence Capture

* Evidence capture shouldn't pre select a record and traverse point. It won't always tie directly to a point in the projects traverses or even the point files. 
* Evidence capture should allow me to specify monument type, township, range, section and section breakdown 
* I need to be able to edit and delete evidence entries
* I should see a title for evidence entries built from the township range and section information
* Evidence monuments may join several sections and possibly border two townships

## Traversals of Records of Survey & Plats

* When entering traversals I would like the code table in global settings to populate a dropdown to specify what the traversal line represents or the point represents.
* I would like codes in global settings to have a field to specify if its a line type or a symbol/point type
* I would like to be able to offset from Center Line of roads and section lines using the (CL, SEC) line codes in a traversal to generate the interor boundary of a subdivision/parcel/lot/property from center lines 
* I would like to specify the closure point of a traversal and see a report in the overview of a traversal showing the error in closing the boundary if a closure is set.
