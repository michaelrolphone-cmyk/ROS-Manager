* I would like a list of the nearest 5 points to my current location shown on the navigation app so I can see what is near me. 
* I would like the help.md refresh button removed. 
* Evidence capture shouldn't pre select a record and traverse point. It won't always tie directly to a point in the projects traverses or even the point files. 
* Evidence capture should allow me to specify monument type, township, range, section and section breakdown 
* I need to be able to edit and delete evidence entries
* I should see a title for evidence entries built from the township range and section information
* Evidence monuments may join several sections and possibly border two townships
* Adding data no longer works, old data overwrites in progress changes and newly added data on app synch
* I don't need an active indicator in the project overview on the spring board
* I would like the composite project thumbnail shown in the project overview on the springboard left of the project name and description with rounded corners
