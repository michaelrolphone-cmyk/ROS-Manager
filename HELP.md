# Survey Tools Help

This guide explains each mini app in simple steps. Everything runs inside `index.html` and saves in your browser. No internet or extra software is needed.

## Springboard (Home)
- Shows the active project's name, client contact info, address, and TRS. Use **Edit Details** to fill these fields.
- Click **Call**, **Email**, or **Map** to use your default phone/email/map apps.
- Use the large tiles to open Traverse Builder, Points, Leveling, Evidence, Equipment, Navigation, or Settings.

## Traverse Builder
- Create a record name and click **+ New Record**.
- Enter the starting point number, coordinates, elevation, backsight azimuth, basis of bearing, and first distance.
- Add each bearing and distance with **+ Add Subsequent Call**. Reorder calls if needed.
- Review the **Traverse Preview** canvas. When ready, click **Generate Carlson Commands** and copy the blocks for your CAD/collector.

## Point File Manager
- Click **Import Points CSV** to load a point file (columns: point number, X/lat, Y/lon, elevation, code, description).
- Use **Add Point Row** for quick manual entries or **New Point File** to start a blank list.
- Choose **Generate Point File** to convert a traverse into points, then **Download Points TXT** to save for your data collector.
- Switch between stored point files using the **Active Point File** dropdown and **Rename Point File** as needed.

## Field Level Book
- Pick or create a **Level run** and name it (for example, "North ditch loop").
- Enter starting point and elevation, then add backsight/foresight shots in order.
- Watch running sums and closure error update automatically. Adjust entries until the closure looks correct.
- Export a PDF summary with **Export as PDF** for your field notes.

## Evidence Records
- Select a record and traverse point to attach evidence to that location.
- Choose the evidence type and condition, then describe the monument in plain language.
- Add tie distances/bearings and upload photos for each tie. Optional: click **Get GPS Location** to stamp coordinates.
- Save the evidence entry to add it to the project-wide list. Use exports when you need corner filing text and backups.

## Equipment Setup Log
- Record setup and teardown date/time, base station height, reference point, and the crew member.
- Pick one or more equipment items used. Optionally grab the GPS position with **Get GPS Location**.
- Describe the day's work goals in **Work / Daily Goal** and save. Each entry appears in **Equipment Records** for review.

## Navigation
- Use **Start Compass** to draw a live compass. Turn your device until the heading matches the target bearing.
- Choose a **Navigate to** target (stakeout point or traverse/equipment source) to see distance, target bearing, and left/right offset.
- If GPS is available, apply localization to show your position and the target on the map preview.
- Clear or refresh sources anytime with the buttons under the selectors.

## Global Settings
- Add reusable **Equipment Names**, **Team Members**, and **Point Codes** so dropdowns stay consistent across projects.
- Use **Download All App Data** to back up every project and setting in one file. Use **Import App Data** to restore from a backup.
